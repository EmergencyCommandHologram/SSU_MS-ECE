# FPGA AESA Radar Control, Simulation, and Visualization

Welcome to my github repository for my masters project at SSU. Currently the repository houses Simulink files which I will be using to program my Artix-7 FPGA, and the Matlab scripts for initializing the variables that the Simulink blocks use.

**Tools and Software used in this project:**
- Simulink/Matlab 2024a
- Vitis Model Composer 2025.1
- Vivado 2025.1
- Artix-7 AC701 Development Board

More will be added to this readme later.
